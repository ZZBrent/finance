A stock trading simulator website that utilize the Google finance API to get up-to-date financial information.

This stock simulation uses a sql database in order to keep track of user accounts including usernames, passwords (using one-way encryption for protection), cash on hand,current stock portfolio, and trading history.

Please note I created this website as part of my studies at Harvard University.
